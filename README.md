# MachineLearningUnsupervised

Unsupervised Learning for Vehicle Silhoutte Classification using Principal Component Analysis 

1. Data Loading and missing value treatment - Loading data set and Initial Analysis to identify and replace missing values
2. Attribute Analysis and suitability for PCA - Analysis of outliers through box plots, pairplot and Correlation Analysis and standardization of data
3. Principal Component Analysis - Building covariance matrix, processing eigen vectors and eigen values, consideration for dimensionality reduction and PCA verification through Pair Plot analysis
4. Models building on chosen Principal Components - Training & Test Split, Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier, Support Vector Classifier basic, Support Vector Classifier with Grid Search Cross Validation
5. Inference about PCA dimensionality reduction and the best suited model
